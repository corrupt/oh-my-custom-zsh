# oh-my-custom-zsh

I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) in a close-to-default configuration. The few modifications I need are collected here.

## usage

* Clone this to a directory of your choice, e.g. `$HOME/.config`
* Uncomment the *ZSH_CUSTOM* line in your `.zshrc` and modify it to point here:
  
  ```shell
  ZSH_CUSTOM=$HOME/.config/oh-my-custom-zsh
